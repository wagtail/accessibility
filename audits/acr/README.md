# Wagtail Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR)

> An [Accessibility Conformance Report](https://www.section508.gov/sell/acr/) is a document that explains how information and communication technology (ICT) products such as software, hardware, electronic content, and support documentation meet (conform to) the Revised 508 Standards for IT accessibility. They are based on the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT¬Æ) format.

Wagtail documents the accessibility of the Wagtail admin interface with ACR / VPAT¬Æ reports, as this format is widely used in a procurement context, particularly in the United States of America.

## Generating reports

Either start from an existing report, or use the [OpenACR Editor](https://acreditor.section508.gov/) to generate the YAML. Then use the [OpenACR CLI](https://github.com/GSA/openacr/blob/main/docs/CLI.md) to generate the HTML and Markdown:

```bash
# Update all with absolute paths:
openacr output -f acr_wagtail_6.3_2.5-edition-wcag-2.2-508-en.yaml -t openacr-markdown-0.1.0.handlebars -c 2.5-edition-wcag-2.2-508-en.yaml -o ./acr_wagtail_6.3_2.5-edition-wcag-2.2-508-en-markdown.md
openacr output -f acr_wagtail_6.3_2.5-edition-wcag-2.2-508-en.yaml -t openacr-html-0.1.0.handlebars -c 2.5-edition-wcag-2.2-508-en.yaml -o ./acr_wagtail_6.3_2.5-edition-wcag-2.2-508-en.html
```

Note the default HTML output relies on external files which we don‚Äôt want to include, and has a few bugs. See commit ae2d51b for necessary changes.
