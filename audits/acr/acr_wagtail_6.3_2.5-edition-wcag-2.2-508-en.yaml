                Wagtail has alt text options for all images by default,
                and ways for site implementers to adjust to their needs.
                The default options offer clear ways to manage alt text
                in context.

                developer documentation (https://docs.wagtail.org/) has been
                reviewed so none of the images are decorative and all images
                have appropriate alt text.

                In the authoring tool, there are a few scenarios in which
                images’ alt text is present but not programmatically associated
                with the image.

                Wagtail implements multiple ways to prevent those errors:


                1. All content entry in the CMS is automatically validated for
                correctness.
                2. For page content and opt-in for other content types, all
                editing actions are reversible.

                3. For page content and opt-in for other content types, all
                editing actions can go through a multi-step publication workflow
                with reviews
                (https://guide.wagtail.org/en-latest/how-to-guides/configure-workflows-for-moderation/).

                For legal and financial requirements specifically, Wagtail
                supports turning on different publication workflows for
                different pages or sections of a site.
