</td> </tr><tr><td>A.2.1.1: Text Alternatives for Rendered Non-Text Content (Level A)</td> <td> Failed</td> <td> <p>For icons within the CMS, all have appropriate alt text. For CMS-managed images, Wagtail renders non-text content in nine scenarios, five of which are related to editing views and would require changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fail: Image upload fields in the image edit/create form. The image’s title displays as a field next to the visuals. The title acts as alt text by default in Wagtail. This is missing a programmatic association between the title text and image.<ul>
<li>Example: <a href="https://static-wagtail-v5-1.netlify.app/admin/images/43/">Wagtail 5.1 - Editing image Boston Cream Pie</a></li>
<li>Current: The alt text is permanently set to the contents of the Title field on page load.</li>
<li>Proposed actions:<ul>
<li>The image could be more clearly associated with the live title field with an <code>aria-labelledby</code>.</li>
<li>The title field could have help text to clarify its use as the image’s alt text (at least in the CMS).</li>
<li>Take CMS users into account in <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/51">RFC 51: Contextual alt text</a></li>
<li>Research alt text requirements for CMS users with disabilities with ATAG experts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fail: Image chooser fields in forms. The selected image’s title displays next to the visuals. The title acts as alt text by default in Wagtail. This is missing a programmatic association between the title text and image.<ul>
<li>Example: <a href="https://static-wagtail-v5-1.netlify.app/admin/pages/77/edit/#panel-child-content-image-section">Wagtail 5.1 - Editing Blog Page: Desserts with Benefits, Image field</a></li>
<li>Current: Alt text set to <code>alt=""</code>, with title displayed after the image.</li>
<li>Proposed actions:<ul>
<li>Associate the visible text with the image with <code>aria-labelledby</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fail: Image chooser fields with a custom alt text field next to them. The custom alt text field is not programmatically associated with the image.<ul>
<li>Example (with Caption field): <a href="https://static-wagtail-v5-1.netlify.app/admin/pages/77/edit/#block-556e76b0-0f5a-42bb-b039-653f3d6b1f0b-section">Wagtail 5.1 - Editing Blog Page: Desserts with Benefits, Image block</a></li>
<li>Alt text set to <code>alt=""</code>, with title displayed after the image, and custom field further down.</li>
<li>Proposed actions:<ul>
<li>Implement this pattern in the bakerydemo website.</li>
<li>Take CMS users into account in <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/51">RFC 51: Contextual alt text</a></li>
<li>Associate both the title of the image, and the custom field, with <code>aria-labelledby</code>, or a combination of it and <code>aria-describedby</code>.</li>
<li>Research alt text requirements for CMS users with disabilities with ATAG experts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fail: Images within rich text fields. Here the image’s title is displayed in a tooltip associated with the image, but there is no programmatic association.<ul>
<li>Example: unavailable</li>
<li>Proposed actions:<ul>
<li>Add demo content following this pattern in bakerydemo.</li>
<li>Add a programmatic association between tooltip text and image with <code>aria-labelledby</code>.</li>
<li>Make sure the image has alt text accessible even when the tooltip is closed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fail: Embeds within rich text fields. Here we display the embed’s thumbnail if there is one. The embed’s title is displayed in a tooltip associated with the embed, but there is no programmatic association.<ul>
<li>Example: <a href="https://static-wagtail-v5-1.netlify.app/admin/pages/77/edit/#block-ac48af95-b3be-4602-8c2f-5c43fc080f17-section">Wagtail 5.1 - Editing Blog Page: Desserts with Benefits, Paragraph block</a></li>
<li>Current: Alt text set to <code>alt=""</code>, with no text displayed near the image.</li>
<li>Proposed actions:<ul>
<li>Add a programmatic association between tooltip text and image with <code>aria-labelledby</code>.</li>
<li>Make sure the thumbnail image has alt text accessible even when the tooltip is closed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside editing views (possibly not part of ATAG requirements), Wagtail renders images in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revisions comparison with images. The image’s title is used as alt text. The title should be visible to the user in the UI, but it is not.<ul>
<li>Example: <a href="https://static-wagtail-v5-1.netlify.app/admin/pages/68/revisions/compare/46...108/">Wagtail 5.1 - Comparing Bread and Circuses</a></li>
<li>Current: the image title is used as <code>alt</code> attribute.</li>
<li>Proposed actions:<ul>
<li>Add demo content following this pattern in bakerydemo.</li>
<li>Display the images’ titles in the UI, with programmatic <code>aria-labelledby</code> associations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Revisions comparison with images or embeds in rich text: currently unimplemented.</li>
<li>Snippets listings. When there is an image column, its alt text is set but invisible in the UI.<ul>
<li>Example: <a href="https://static-wagtail-v5-1.netlify.app/admin/snippets/base/person/">Wagtail 5.1 – Snippets People</a></li>
<li>Current: the image title is used as <code>alt</code> attribute.</li>
<li>Proposed actions:<ul>
<li>Display the images’ titles in the UI, with programmatic <code>aria-labelledby</code> associations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Image gallery. Here we display the title underneath the image as alt text, in a <code>figcaption</code>.<ul>
<li>Example: <a href="https://static-wagtail-v5-1.netlify.app/admin/images/">Wagtail 5.1 – Images</a></li>
<li>Current: Alt text set to <code>alt=""</code>, but the image is within a <code>figure</code> with the image’s title as <code>figcaption</code>.</li>
<li>Proposed actions:<ul>
<li>Associate the text and the image with <code>aria-labelledby</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendation for Wagtail: Consider whether to sign-post the Title field as the image’s alt text in the CMS, or add another mandatory "default alt text" to the image model, which can be used as alt text whenever images are rendered <em>in the CMS</em>, and potentially also in the frontend (with clear options to mark images as decorative or define alt text in context).</p>

</td> </tr><tr><td>A.2.1.2: Alternatives for Rendered Time-Based Media (Level A)</td> <td> Failed</td> <td> <p>Wagtail’s only time-based media is animated GIFs. Their text alternatives work identically to other images in Wagtail, with the same characteristics listed in SC A.2.1.1.</p>
</td> </tr><tr><td>A.2.2.1: Editing-View Status Indicators (Level A)</td> <td> Failed</td> <td> <p>Wagtail uses the following status indicators in editing views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fail: Comments on fields. Comments are displayed as a "speech bubble" icon next to the field they are associated with. The association isn’t programmatically exposed. Even visually, the presence of a comment can only be identified on hover/focus within the field’s area.<ul>
<li>Example: <a href="https://static-wagtail-v5-1.netlify.app/admin/pages/60/edit/">Editing Home Page: Welcome to the Wagtail bakery!</a></li>
<li>Proposed actions:<ul>
<li>Add a programmatic association between fields and their comment presence indicator</li>
<li>Make the comment presence indicator visible at all times.</li>
<li>(WCAG issue) Make the comment addition buttons visible at all times in commenting mode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fail: Comments in rich text. Comments are displayed as highlighted text within the rich text field. The association isn’t programmatically exposed.<ul>
<li>Example: none available</li>
<li>Proposed actions:<ul>
<li>Add demo content following this pattern in bakerydemo.</li>
<li>Research how other WYSIWYG interfaces programmatically associate comments with runs of text.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pass: Character count for rich text fields. The character count is displayed as a number next to the field it is associated with. The association is programmatically exposed with <code>aria-describedby</code> ("Character count: 18/120").<ul>
<li>Example <a href="https://static-wagtail-v5-1.netlify.app/admin/pages/82/edit/#panel-child-content-preface-section">Editing Recipe page: Southern Cornbread, Preface field</a></li>

<li>TBC (work in progress): content quality checks within page editor.</li>
</ul>
